I am a senior operations engineer with over 17 years of experience in multiple environments using a wide range of Unixes (Linux, BSD and Solaris), configuration management tools (Puppet, Chef and CFengine2) and platforms (AWS, vCloud and bare metal) while supporting applications in a variety of languages (Ruby, Perl, Python, Java and Go). I can help infrastructure teams to define a product road map both as a technical lead and as a product owner.

## Employment History ##

### February 2016 – present: Head of Web Operations for [Government Digital Service][]

As head of the Web Operations community at GDS, I worked with the other technical heads of community to look after our community members. I provided mentorship and line management to around 20 other engineers, and made sure they were learning and developing. I empowered the community to self-organise events and to share learnings between teams, and I also helped organise several off-site events.

I participated in the government-wide Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) effort to define a career path for people within the software engineering community. My position as the main point of contact for recruitment of Web Operations engineers within GDS helped me realise that this was a burden that needed to be shared, and so I created a rota of people to be main contact week-to-week.

After a decison was made to change how we managed platforms, I was part of the team which enabled this transition. My main roles were liaising with my community and helping to define the work that the new central teams would do along with the existing product managers and delivery managers.

While Head of Web Operations, for a time I was also the product manager for the GOV.UK infrastructure team and participated in the planning for the whole of GOV.UK. I worked with the Government PaaS team on planning the migration of GOV.UK to the governemnt PaaS.

### December 2014 – January 2016: Senior Web Operations Engineer for [Government Digital Service][]

As a senior engineer on the GOV.UK infrastructure team, I worked with technical architects and senior developers to define the technical direction of GOV.UK. I continued to work on several large projects which provided the foundation for migrating us to a different hosting provider. I eventually became the technical lead and product owner for the team, helping to set our direction and make technical decisions. I also helped to mentor our new staff members.

During this period, I was made Acting Head of Web Operations, at which point I relinquished my tech lead post but continued to manage the product. 

### February 2013 – November 2014: Web Operations Engineer for [Government Digital Service][]

I joined GDS as a member of the Infrastructure and Tools team within GOV.UK. I worked on several major projects including migrating [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk) to a [new platform](https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2014/03/28/migrating-govuk-infrastructure/), leading technically on the setting up of a new logging infrastructure and helping with the procurement of a new CDN. I managed the team's backlog when we lacked a delivery manager, and facilitated several retrospectives. I participated fully in our second line support model and out of hours on call rota, and trained several of our developers so that they could contribute to second line support. I also helped maintain several environments and Puppet repositories.

### October 2010 – February 2013: Systems Architect for [TagMan][]

At TagMan I was responsible for maintaining and growing a platform serving approximately two billion hits a month spread over six points of presence across the world. During my time at TagMan I worked both in the Operations Team and in a development team focused on improving the scalability of our architecture.
